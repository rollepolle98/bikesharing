## Background and Purpose

This analysis is based on NYC Citi Bikes which are a form rideshare transportation. The reason for analyzing this data is to help aid in a proposal to key stakeholders on whether or not it is a solid buisness plan to expand. To start off, data engineering was performed on a csv file to change the datetype of a column in order to create time series graphs in Tableau (./bikesharing/Notebook/NYC_CitiBike_Challenge.ipynb) . Next using Tableau, I created visualizations that show the differences of rides based on a large amount of criteria. Next I used all of this information to create a store ending with an dashboard and summary based on all the data at hand and the results.


## Results and Analysis

Below I will attach screenshots of the output and analysis with explanations but my link to my Tableau story is right here...[NYC_BIKE_STORY](https://public.tableau.com/profile/nicholas.singh#!/vizhome/NYC_CITI_BIKES/TripsbyWeekdayforEachHour?publish=yes "NYC BIKE STORY")
